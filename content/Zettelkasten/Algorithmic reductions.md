# Algorithmic reductions
Using existing algorithms to solve new problems.

Solving X problem using algorithm Y which we treet as a [[Black box]] that solves problem Z correctly.
- It is important to be able to tree Y as a black box and not worry about it's internals
- A good approach is to view it as a magic solution

Recursion is an example of reduction
- If problem can be solved directly -> solve it
- Else, reduce the problem to one or more instance of **the same problem**
- A hard part of being comfortable with recursion is [[Black box]]ing the recursive magic (inductive hypothesis). We only care about reducing the problem - the recursion *fairy* will solve it
