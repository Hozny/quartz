# Andrew Huberman nutrition
Andrew Huberman's diet and supplement routine everybody! (-:

Specialty: 
For last +10 years: Intermittent Fasting (12 - 16 hours in total with sleep) after waking up until noon.

tl;dr version: 	
- Get up and hydrate -> Fast till noon -> Train at the end of the fast -> Eat at noon (if trained eat some carbs and protein; if not reduce the carbs to about half its size) -> In the afternoon eat something low carb-ish -> In the evening eat carbs (still in moderation, not some huge portions)


Morning
- Gets up early and hydrates - puts salt and lemon in water to delay the hunger
Note: supposedly a lot of people who follow low-carb diets are sodium deficient, so they should follow this advice as well
- Caffeine (Coffee or Yerba mate) 1,5 - 2 hours after waking to avoid crash later
- Fasts for 6 - 8 hours until noon
     â€¢ Sometimes he breaks that fast and eats something sooner like 4 Eggs - it happens, after all he is just a hu(ber)man :-)
- He does training late in the morning
	     
   
Noon
First meal of the day:
- He eats mostly based on appetite
- Almost always low-carb meal - more mental clarity provided that glycogen storages have been repacked from the previous day or so (see Dinner part)

- (Rib-eye) Steak or Ground Beef, Olive oil, some Brazil Nuts, maybe some Veggies (Tomatoes, Avocados, Broccoli, Spinach...)
    â€¢ However if training will be really hard like some (heavy) resistance training then he eats carbs (starches) and fruits with the meal, for example.: Bowl of Rice or Bowl of Oatmeal + Small Pot of Butter
	
Supplements 
- Drinks Athletic Greens
- EEAs after training


Afternoon	
- Hydrates
- Eats nuts (he didn't mention if he eats seeds or not as well) like Almonds
	
Supplements
- Athletic Greens
- Whey protein


Dinner	
- If he eats too much meat near bed time, the quality of his sleep deteriorates - most likely because the gastric clearance is too long - so he doesn't do that!
- Walks after or before dinner
- Eats mostly carbs - starches
    â€¢ Bowl of Pasta or Rice, Salad, sometimes fish like Tuna fish or Salmon
-  Goes to sleep around 10:30 - 11:00 PM (22:30 - 23:00) - I guess he eats 2-3 hours before sleep?


Supplements in general
- He is not fond of pro/pre-biotics supplements, instead he suggests:
	â€¢ 2-4 servings of low-sugar fermented foods a day: kimchi, sauerkraut, natto etc. as those greatly decrease the number of inflammatory markers in the so-called "Inflammatome"
- Multivitamin - B-vitamins help to metabolize foods more quickly
- Boron 2-4 mg
- Vitamin K2
- Athletic Greens
- Whey protein
- EEAs after training
- Fish Oil - at least 2 g of EPA (Thorne Fish Oil + Tablespoon of the Carlson's Fish Oil with the lemon flavour)  - antidepressant effects, blood lipid profile effects, skin health, mental healthâ€¦ - he takes it as he isn't really fond of the taste of fish
- From time to time he takes:
    â€¢ Vitamin E, CLA, Green Tea Extract, Garlic Extract

- He didn't mention any other supplements in this video, however I know he is taking some additional supplements/nootropics like Magnesium L-Threonate, L-Theanine etc. More on that here:
