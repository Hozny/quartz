# Ass to grass split squat
ATG split squat

## Technique
1. Find your step length. Too short doesn't allow depth. Too far doesn't allow knees over toes.
	2. back toes should be still curled not rolling over. back knee should not touch floor.
2. Elevate front foot if it is too hard to reach bottom. Add assistance for arm if still too hard. If it is still too hard go back to earlier exercises to build prerequisite strength.
3. Lower down till full in bottom position, fully pause, come back up maintaining form.
