# China demographic collapse

China had lot's of growth with a population that didn't grow along with it. They are facing a population crisis where there isn't enough economically productive workers.

The real estate market in China operates under the assumption the population is growing, but the home-buying demographic is going to shrink rapidly in the near future.
