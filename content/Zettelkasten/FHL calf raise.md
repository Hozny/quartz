# FHL calf raise

## Technique
1. Hands against wall feet out behind you to the point where calfs are slightly raised off floor. Feet further back makes it harder.
2. Raise until weight is all on big toe.
3. Feet further back is harder, one leg at a time is even harder.

## Why
Flexor Hallucis Longus absorbs impact when landing so strengthening it decreases the absorption required by your knees. It is the first muscle that absorbs when you land on your foot.

The FHL calf raise ensures the weight is on your big toe more than a regular calf raise and stretches the ankle more. Ankle mobility is very important for knee health.
