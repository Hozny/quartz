# Gaussian distribution
If we assume a Guassian data fora  given data then
1. sample mean and median should be close
2. skewness close to 0 and kurtosis close 3
3. 95% of observations lie within 2 standard deviations of the mean

If any one of these fails by a large degree then it is usually sufficient to warrant concerns (does not follow gaussian)
