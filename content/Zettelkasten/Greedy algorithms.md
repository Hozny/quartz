# Greedy algorithms

Examples:
- [[Minimum number of coins to make change]]
- [[Maximum number of non-overlapping intervals]]

## Proving greedy algorithms
There are two general techniques that could be used
1. show that the greedy solution stays ahead (optimal) all the time
2. "exchange" proof 
	1. get an optimal solution and show you can swap it around and arrive at greedy solution maintaining optimality
