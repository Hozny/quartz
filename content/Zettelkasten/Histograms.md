# Histograms

Basic idea is to create a graphical summary that is comparable with a [Probability density function](Probability%20density%20function.md)].

- the area of the bars should match the frequency (width=1 -> height=freq)
- usually intervals of equal width

Relative frequency histogram

- the total area here will sum to 1
- we divide the height of a regular histogram by the sample size
