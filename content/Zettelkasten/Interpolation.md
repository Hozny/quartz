# Interpolation
Interpolate (guess a function) for a list of (x, y) pairs.
- focus of application in cs370 is on interpolations applicability to computer graphics

## Polynomial interpolation
Theorem: Given n data pairs (xi , yi), i = 1, . . . , n with distinct xi, there is a unique polynomial p(x) of degree not exceeding n âˆ’ 1 that interpolates this data.

### Lagrange form

- this allows us to interpolate without solving the vadnermonde system

### Piecewise Hermite interpolation
If we want to interpolate a function and its derivative at vertain points we can set up the equations again to solve them uniquely.
