# Knees over toes calf raise

## Technique
1. Stand about arms length away from wall
2. Bend knees over toes to a comfortable level. Ideally ankles should lift off floor slightly
3. Lift your calves like a calf raise
4. Once it is easy to do 25 reps with knee bend and ankle lifting off floor, switch to single leg for harder variation

## Why
Two parts of the calves, gastroc and soleus. Soleus is worked more in a bent knee calf raise than standing calf raise. 

Seated calf raises are also good because the knee is bent.
