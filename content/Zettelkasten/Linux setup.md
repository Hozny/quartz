# Linux setup

## Distro
- Endeavour OS ([[EndeavourOS install and setup]])
	- arch linux without having to deal with install process
	
## Window manager
- DWM 
	- simple, minimal and already effective
	- probably use Luke Smith's dwm build
- i3
	- more resources for using it 
	- official documentation here: https://discovery.endeavouros.com/installation/i3-wm/2021/03/
	- I think it is easier to install i3 alongside KDE as opposed to DWM (not sure about this didn't do much research)
