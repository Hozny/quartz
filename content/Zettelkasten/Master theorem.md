Rough proof idea:

- notice each level has a denominator of $b^k$ and coeffcient $a$
	- if $a < b^k$ then each level is getting exponentially smaller than the previous level. And so the highest level dominates (i.e, O(n^k))
	- if $a > b^k$ then each level is getting bigger and the last level dominates
