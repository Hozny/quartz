# Models of computation

## Random Access Machine (RAM) model
- "random access" means we access memory location *i* in 1 time step 

We need to account for "size" of a memory location 
- good compromise: word RAM
	- each location holds on word
	- assume number of bits in word is $\Theta(\log{n}), n = \text{input size}$
