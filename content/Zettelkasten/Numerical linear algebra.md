# Linear algebra
Solving systems of equations using [[Gaussian elimination]]


![](Assets/Pasted%20image%2020220123215417.png)
- so [Gaussian elimination](Gaussian%20elimination) factors A into product of upper and lower unit diagonal matrices
- if you save the multipliers in the lower triangular part of the matrix when performing Gaussian elimination you end up with L (A = LU factorization)

Solving linear systems computationally we perform A = LU factorization then use forward and back solves
- this allows for cheaper recomputation using different x in Ax = b
- cheaper computing $A^{-1}$ (note it is 4 times more expensive to find Ax = b using the inverse)

## LRU stability
We can have numbers approach 0 because and then because of roundoff errors 

## Partial pivoting
This allows us to decrease roundoff errors in [[Gaussian elimination]] with increased stability.

- This is basically a generalization of stander GE theorem (P would b identity in normal case)

## NLA conditioning
Measuring the maximum potential accuracy
