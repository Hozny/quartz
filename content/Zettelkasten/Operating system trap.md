# Operating system trap
A trap is a request for the CPU to interrupt current code and elevate to **kernel mode**

When a process calls a trap the kernel must know what code to excecute. For that there are **Trap tables** which are defined on boot up and inform the CPU of what to execute for specific hardware traps.
