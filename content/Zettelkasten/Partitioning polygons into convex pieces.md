# Partitioning polygons into convex pieces
## Partitioning polygons into convex pieces
There exists an O(n^3 log n) algorithm using [[Dynamic programming]], but it's not simple.
- This would make a good paper for final project of [[CS 763 - Computational geometry]]

### Aproximation < 4 * min solution
- remove a chord if it leaves convex pieces

Claim # of pieces <= 4 * min:
