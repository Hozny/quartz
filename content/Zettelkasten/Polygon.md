# Polygon
Definition: A polygon is specified by points on a plane, called vertices $p_1p_2 \cdots p_n$. The  edges $e = p_i p_{i+1}$.
- **simple** polygons are such that two edges intersect only at a common vertex
- *note:* that the vertices are a single chain of vertices (all one line)

See [[Jordan curve theorem]]

## Testing if a point is inside/outside a polygon
- Count the number of crossing of a ray coming out of the point
	- odd number of crossings $\iff$ p is inside
	- obv. even crossings -> then p is outside
