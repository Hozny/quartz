# Polyhedron
Definition: finite connected set of (plane) polygons called **faces** such that
1. if two faces intersect it is only at a common vertex or edge
2. every edge of a face is an edge of exactly one other face
3. the faces surrounding each vertex form a single circuit

Note a terrain is not a polyhedron because the boundary edges are connected to only one face.

## Platonic solids
Polyhedra which have the same identical faces to form them in 3D.

There are 5
- Tetrahedron, Octahedron, Cube, Icosahedron, Dodecahedron
