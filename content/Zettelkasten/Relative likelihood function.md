# Relative likelihood function

$\hat{\theta}$ is the maximum likelihood probability.

Relative likelihood function
$$R(\theta) = \frac{L(\theta)}{L(\hat{\theta})}$$
- notice the denominator is a constant

There is a log-likelihood function just $\log{L(\theta)}$
- mainly used for manipulating (e.g, deriving) likelihood functions easily
