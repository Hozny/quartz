# Sample correlation
The sample correlation is a measure of a **linear** relationship

Interpretation
- if the value of r is close to 1 we have a strong positive linear relationship
- if the value of r is close to 0 we have no linear relationship
- if the value of r is close to -1 we have a strong negative linear relationship


Why is $$[(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})]$$ positive with positive correlation and ndegative with negative relationship.
