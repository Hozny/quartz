# Sissy squat

## Technique
1. Stand up and bend knees to the ground controllably. 
2. To make it easier add something to rest on behind you to allow control until easier depth. To make it harder use a stair case for even lower depth.

## Why
Similar benefits to [Ass to grass split squat](Ass%20to%20grass%20split%20squat.md) and [Patric step](Patric%20step.md) but it targets muscles at more demanding levels. Ankle mobility is also pushed to limits.
