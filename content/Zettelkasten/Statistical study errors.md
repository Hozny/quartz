# Statistical study errors
The target population is not the same as the study population, so there is an error when trying to approximate the target via a study sample.

There is a sample error when measuring returns from the study (for example people giving permission to be sampled).

There is a measurement error. From the people who do agree there is a measurement error in how we colelct the data.

Perfect theoretical population -> error in choosing a subset -> error in sample of subset -> error in measuring sample
- Perfect -> study error -> sample error -> measurement error

**Notice** if we have truly random sampling there cannot be sampling error since the sample is perfectly chose. This is usually impossible to achieve.
