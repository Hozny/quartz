# Statistics definitions
List of statistics words and their definitions.

**Warning:** common mistakes on exams are definitions that are not precise
- all UW students (does this include current/alumni and undergrad/grad ??)

## The list
1. **Unit** - a thing (person, place, etc.) that we can take a measurement of
2. **Population** - a collection of units (all persons aged 90+)
3. **Process** - a system that produces units (over time)
	- hits on a website can be considered as a process
4. **[Variates](Variates.md)** - characteristics of units usually represented with X, Y, Z
	- continuous, discrete, categorical, ordinal, complex
5. **Attributes** - an attribute (function) of a population (not sample) or process is a *function of a variate* defined for *all units* in the pop. / process
6. **Sample survey** - a study which uses a sample population to represent a *finite* population (election surveys)
7. **Observational study** - a study where information is collected about a process/pop. without any attempt to change any variates. (measuring alcohol levels before lectures on monday mornings)
8. **Experimental study** - a study where the researcher changes or sets the values for one more more variates (telling a group of students their blood alochol level will be measured vs. a group where they aren't told)
9. The (sample) *range** is defined as the maximum observation - minimum observation (max difference)
10. Sample **mean**, **median**, **mode** (see [Measures of variability or dispersion](Measures%20of%20variability%20or%20dispersion.md))
10. Sample **variance**, standard **deviation**
11. The $p^{th}$ **quantile**, **percentile** a percentile is just quantile\*100
12. The **interquartile range (IQR)** defines as IQR = q(0.75) - q(0.25). 
	- this can be considered a robust alternative to sample range
	- becareful if the data is discrete (is the interval closed or open??)
13. **[[Sample skewness]]**
14. **[[Sample kurtosis]]**
15. **[[Gaussian distribution]]**
16. [[Maximum likelihood estimation]] / [[Relative likelihood function]]
17. [[Probability distributions]] ([[Poisson distribution]], [[Gaussian distribution]], [[Binomial distribution]], [[Geometric distribution]])
18. [[qqplot]]
19. [[Method of moment estimates]]
20. [[Statistical moment]]
21. [[PPDAC study process]] (Problem, Plan, Data, Analysis, Conclusion)
22. [[Target trials]] (not required for this course)
23. [[Target population]] or target process
