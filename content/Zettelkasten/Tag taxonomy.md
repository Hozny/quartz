# Tag Taxonomy
Nested tag system for tagging notes

- 📥 Inbox | inputs i.e, entries that I will be working on (not flushed out evergreen yet)
	- 📚 | Note on a concept that already exists
		- Note's of a video / podcast / book are all grouped here (separating them seems contradictory with conceptual note taking)
	- 💭 | Thought  i.e, not an established concept (at least to my knowledge)
- 📝Notes | Note entries that are more flushed out than an inbox entry
	- 🌱 | Need to flush out (doesn't describe the concept well)
	- 🌞 | Describes the concept well but needs stronger linking
	- 🌲 | Evergreen atomic concept with strong links  
- ✅To-Do | items with a task that needs to be done
	- 🟩 Easy work
	- 🟧 Medium work
	- 🟥 Lots of work 
- 🗺️ Maps of Content | the structure that emerge naturally in notes
- 🕸️ Graph groupings
	- 🟤 Conceptual notes ([[Evergreen notes | Evergreen]] / Zettelkasten notes)
	- 🔵 Implementation notes |  non-conceptual implementations (e.g, bfs in python)
	- 🟣 Proper noun notes | notes about specific nouns (person, application)
		- not conceptual so not Evergreen, weakly evergreen since they're revisited
	- ⚪ Project documents (business plans, room designs, etc...)
- 🏷️ Tag | for links to empty files (i.e, topic links that don't yet exist)
	- Some file linking to [[Programming]] where the programming file is empty with 🏷️
	- Allows for quickly finding such empty topic/tag files 
- 🦴 Utility note | not really notes - utility files such as tracking lists, etc.
	- Bone emoji because such files usually go stale and die off

## [[Note taxonomy]]
These tags are used to label the note's identiy. So the "tag taxonomy" actually describes the note's taxonomy
