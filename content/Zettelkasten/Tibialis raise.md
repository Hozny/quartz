# Tibialis raise

## Technique
1. Stand against a wall and move feet out to a comfortable position. Make sure feet aren't slippery against floor
2. Raise toes and hold for 2 seconds at the top
3. Feet further from wall makes it harder, closer makes it easier
4. The higher the heel the harder (flat shoes are easier)

## Why
Tibialis is responsible for slowing you down when moving forward. When playing a sport and moving fast you put a lot of force on the tibialis and whatever isn't handled by it goes to your knee.
