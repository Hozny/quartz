# Variates
Variates:  characteristics of units usually represented with X, Y, Z
continuous - those that can theoretically be measured to infinite accuracy (height, weight, time)

**discrete** - can only take finite or countably infinite values (number of car accidents)

**categorical** - fall into a non-numeric category (eye colour, hair colour, etc.)

**ordinal** - categories with an implied order (strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, etc..)
- **Warning:** be very careful of ordinal variates into discrete ones
- Days of the week is **categorical** not ordinal, since the ordering of the days is not implied there is no reason for the order. Poor Satisfactory Good has two extremes, days of the week don't.

- notice the difference in gaps between sizes and when mapping the sizes to 1,2,3,4...

**complex** - more open ended responses. Usually require some processing to interpret them (twitter sentiment analysis)

## Statistical importance
Usually the type of variate determines what kind of distribution we would use to model it.
- there are times we would deviate from these rules 


## Selft test questions

What type of variate is measuring time to the nearest second.
- this is continuous since in theory it could be measured infinitely (if all ages in a study can be 1 of 2 choices we probably wouldn't use a continuous distribution)
