# My notes

Almost everything I write is in Markdown using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). The main reasons are that it uses Markdown and lets me link documents and view them as a graph.

This website is created using Quartz, a Hugo based tool that turns Obsidian notes into HTML.

Most of the stuff I write is not meant for others to read. 

These are some that might be more readable:
